### How was it created?

Crypto Notify Central (formerly Definotify) was developed for my individual purpose since I have been actively borrowing assets on Venus.io - my favourite lending protocol.
Proactively monitor Borrow Limit/Health Factor on these protocols, crucial for preventing liquidation risk.
High demand from crypto investors who wanted to have a similar service like mine.
Highly potential and profitable opportunity to turn my personal project into a commercial software.

AI trading tool (based on complicated factors like Lending platform’s interests, Funding rate, Option Trading’s max pain prices, DXY, CPI, etc…) to predict and give signals when we need to buy or sell Bitcoin in short term.


### Why Telegram?

Telegram is the main tool and popular in any crypto communities.
Telegram is flexible and reliable enough for building an application on top of it.
Potential to use Telegram advertisement platform to attract potential crypto investors.
